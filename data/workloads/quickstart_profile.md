# quickstart

- Requests: 30
- Seed: 42

## Rationale
Minimal replay workload for CPU-only pipeline smoke tests.

## Notes
This dataset is synthetic/public (no private logs). It is designed to:
- exercise replay mode
- include realistic long-tail length distributions
- (agent_like) simulate multi-turn context growth
